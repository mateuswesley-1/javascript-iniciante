// js types: primitive types and object types

// primitive: numbers, strings and booleans
// null and underfined are primitive values, even though
// they are not numbers, strings or booleans.

// object: unorded colection of properties where each property has a name
// and a value (a primitive value)

// An array is a special kind of object that
// represents an ordered collection of numbered values

// a function is an object that has executable code 
// associated with it.



//JS convert values liberally from one type to another
//the == equality operator performs type conversions
// if you give a number when a string is expected, 
//a conversion is made automatically


//variables are untyped and separated in global e local variab√ßes
//local variables are declared inside a function, and 
//are visible only to code inside that function
